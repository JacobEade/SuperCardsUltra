# SuperCardsUltra Scenarios

1. Four friends decide they want to play a card game. They all launch SuperCardsUltra and try to connect to a lobby. They realize that they are unable to connect because they are not on a LAN connection. They then download a third-party VPN software, such as LogMeIn Hamachi, to extend a LAN connection to all of them, and try to join a lobby again. This time the successfully connect to the lobby and start choosing the game they wished to play between Mao, Pedro, Blackjack, and Texas Hold Em.

2. Nearing the end of a game of Pedro the score is 84-85, Player 2 and player 4 are on team 2. The initial hands of 9 cards each are dealt to each player starting with player 1, making player 4 the dealer. The first player to bid is on team 2, however he doesn't have a good hand, so he passes. The second player to bid is on team 1, he has the Ace, King, Queen of spades, but nothing else in spades so he bids 6. The third player, doesn't have much of anything to bid on so he passes as well. The fourth player, also doesn't have a good hand and passes as well. Since the second player had the highest bid, he calls his suit as spades, and the system removes all cards the players have that aren't spades, or the 5 of clubs. Showing every how many cards each play went in with, player 1 and player 3 both go in with no cards, player 4 goes in with 1 card, and player 3 goes in with his 3 cards. They are dealt the reamining 18 cards in the deck up to 6 cards. However since there is not enough cards to get everyone back to 6 cards, player 4, the dealer, is given 4 of the discarded cards to fill his hand. At this point, since player 2 got the bid he leads with his Ace. Player 3 plays a 2 to since the 2 catches itself. Player 4, plays his only card the 5 of clubs. Player 1 plays a 3. Since the Ace is the highest face value card player 2 takes the Ace, the 3, and the 5 and sets them aside until the end of the hand. Since player 3 played a 2 he takes it and sets it aside. Player 2, still haveing the lead, plays his next highest card the King. Player 3 plays the 4. Player 4 has no more cards on suit so he is out. Player 1 plays the 6. Player 2 again has the highest card and takes the King, 4, and 6 and sets them with the cards he took last hand. Player 2 has the lead and leads his last card the Queen. Player 3 plays a 7 while player 1 plays a 9. Player 2 has the highest cards again and sets the Queen, 7, and 9 with the other cards his taken. At this point since both players on team 2 are out of cards the round is called, and the remaining cards that the other players have they keep and points are tallied. Team 2 have 2 cards worth points, the Ace which is worth 1 point, and the 5 of clubs being worth 5, made their bid of 6 putting their point total at 91. Team 1 have 4 cards worth points, the 2 worth 1 point, the 5 worth 5 points, the 10 worth 1 point, and the Jack worth 3 points, got 10 points that round bringing their total score to 94. Since both teams reached at least 91 points in the same round, the team that had the bid wins the hand, so team 2 wins with 91 points.
