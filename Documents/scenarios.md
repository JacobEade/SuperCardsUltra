# SuperCardsUltra Scenarios

1. Four friends decide they want to play a card game. They all launch SuperCardsUltra and try to connect to a lobby. They realize that they are unable to connect because they are not on a LAN connection. They then download a third-party VPN software, such as LogMeIn Hamachi, to extend a LAN connection to all of them, and try to join a lobby again. This time the successfully connect to the lobby and start choosing the game they wished to play between Mao, Pedro, Blackjack, and Texas Hold Em.

2. Nearing the end of a game of Pedro the score is 85-84. The first player to bid is on team 2, however he doesn't have a good hand, so he passes. The second player to bid is on team 1, he has the Ace, King, Queen of spades, but nothing else in spades so he bids 6. The third player, doesn't have much of anything to bid on so he passes as well. The fourth player, also doesn't have a good hand and passes as well. Since the second player had the highest bid, he calls his suit as spades, and everyone drops all the cards the have that aren't spades.
